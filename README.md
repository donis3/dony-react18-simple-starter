# Donis' Basic Starter Template

This repo is for my personal single page react projects. Its a simple starter template using React + Vite + Typescript + Tailwind.

### Navigation

Navigation is handled in a single page using react-scroll. (@types/react-scroll required for TS support)

### Other Packages

-   React-Icons: Easy to use icon implementation
-   react-type-animation: Typing animations used in hero section.
-   twmerge: Tailwind class merging and conflict resolution
-   clsx: conditional class merging used alongside with tw merge
